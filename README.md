# EEG Universal Pipeline

**Unlocking the brain, one pulse at a time.**  
A modular, multi-purpose EEG Machine Learning pipeline for real-world impact — from assistive tech to emotion-aware systems and biometric security.

## Subprojects

### 1. **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**
**Let the mind control machines.**  
Use EEG to drive robotic limbs, type on keyboards, or move cursors using thoughts alone.

- Dataset: MI-EEG, OpenBCI, PhysioNet
- Models: Motor intention classifiers
- Use Case: Assistive tech for paralyzed users

### 2. **Emotion Recognition from EEG**
**Build tech that knows how you feel.**  
Classify emotions like joy, stress, or calm using brainwaves.

- Dataset: DEAP, DREAMER
- Use Case: Adaptive gaming, mood-aware apps, therapy tools

### 3. **Mental Fatigue / Cognitive Load Detection**
**Your brain says you're tired — before you do.**  
Detect mental exhaustion to improve safety and performance.

- Dataset: SEED, Cognitive Load Benchmark
- Use Case: Early fatigue detection in high-stress jobs (e.g. pilots, drivers)

### 4. **Brainprint Authentication**
**Biometric login using brain patterns.**  
Your EEG is your password.

- Use Case: Secure authentication that’s hard to replicate or spoof

## Why This Matters

Brain-Computer Interfaces are no longer sci-fi.  
We're building **real pipelines** for **real-world** impact.  
Open-source. Scalable. Audacious.
